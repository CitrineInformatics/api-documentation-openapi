            description: Queries against the units of the value. When possible, units will be automatically normalized (along with the _value_ field). This allows for searching across mixed sets of units stored for a value in different records. If the value that is stored can be directly converted to this set of units, that conversion is automatically applied. For example, a query for a value in units of eV might match a record with a value stored in units of J; the value that is returned from the query would be converted to eV.
