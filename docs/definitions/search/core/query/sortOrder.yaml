    Whether to sort a field in ascending or descending order. This operates in lexicographical or numeric modes depending on the value in a field. When a field contains mixed types across records, it is always assumed that a numeric value is less than a non-numeric (string) value. Currently, lexicographical sorting is only supported through the first 10 characters of a string.


    The system will handle sorting across mixed units so long as they are suported. For example, if a field contains a temperature value reported in K in some records, but degrees C in others, then the system will handle returning a record with 50 K before 10 degrees C when sorting in ascending order.


    In the case that a field is being sorted on that contains some supported units and some unsupported ones, then the supported values will always appear before the unsupported ones, regardless of whether sorting in ascending or descending order. For example, if a field contains temperature values where some are reported in K, others in degrees C, and finally others in some unknown set of units, then the values reported in K and degrees C will always appear before the unrecognized units when sorting on that field.
