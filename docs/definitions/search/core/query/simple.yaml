    A simple query that is run against all fields that contain string values. This query is run against all fields in the current object, in the children of this object, in the children's children, and so on. Boolean OR logic is applied between all of these queries.


    Query strings are tokenized on whitespace unless surrounded by quotes. For example, `GaN "band gap"` tokenizes to `GaN` and `band gap` where each token must match its entire phrase in a record. Tokens are executed with boolean OR logic. Therefore, `GaN "band gap"` matches records that contain `GaN` or `band gap`.


    Since simple filters are extremely inclusive operations (only one token needs to match against any field in this object or its children), it is typically recommended that relevancy scoring be turned on for the query so that the records that match the most values are ranked the highest.
