description: When multiple queries appear in a list, the logic defines the way in which each will be interpreted. "SHOULD" is equivalent to boolean _OR_ logic. "MUST" is eqivalent to boolean _AND_ logic. "MUST_NOT" is equivalent to boolean _NOT_ logic. "OPTIONAL" does not have an effect on whether a record matches; the specific query element is ignored during the primary search for records in scope. However, "OPTIONAL" queries are executed on subsequent steps such as extractions and data statistics gathering. When logic is set to a null value, it is interpreted as "SHOULD".
