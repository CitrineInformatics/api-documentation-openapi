description: >
    When multiple queries appear in a list, the logic defines the way in which each will be interpreted.

    - SHOULD is equivalent to boolean OR logic.

    - MUST is eqivalent to boolean AND logic.

    - MUST_NOT is equivalent to boolean NOT logic.

    - OPTIONAL does not have an effect on whether a record matches; the specific query element is ignored during the primary search for records in scope. However, OPTIONAL queries are executed on subsequent steps such as extractions and data statistics gathering.

    - null is interpreted as SHOULD.


    When multiple queries exist with SHOULD logic, a minimum of 1 must match in order for the overall query to match.
