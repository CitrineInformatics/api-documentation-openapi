description: >
    When multiple queries appear in a list, the logic defines the way in which each will be interpreted.

    * SHOULD is equivalent to boolean OR logic.
    * MUST is eqivalent to boolean AND logic.
    * MUST_NOT is equivalent to boolean NOT logic.
    * OPTIONAL does not have an effect on whether a record matches; the specific query element is ignored during the primary search for records in scope. However, OPTIONAL queries are executed on subsequent steps such as extractions and data statistics gathering.

    When multiple queries exist with SHOULD logic, a minimum of 1 must match in order for the overall query to match. When logic is set to a null value, it is interpreted as SHOULD.
