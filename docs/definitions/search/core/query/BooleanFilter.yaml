    A filter against the value of a boolean-typed field.


    Filter for a value equal to true.
    ```javascript
    {
        "equal": true
    }
    ```


    Filter for a value that exists.
    ```javascript
    {
        "exists": true
    }
    ```


    Filter for a value that either does not exist or exists with a value of false.
    ```javascript
    {
        "logic": "MUST_NOT",
        "equal": true
    }
    ```


    Filter for a value that either does not exist or exists with a value of true (this demonstrates nesting of filters - the same filter could be generated in a similar way to the previous example). The default logic between the two filters is SHOULD.
    ```javascript
    {
        "filter": [{
            "exists": false
        },{
            "equal": true
        }]
    }
    ```

    equal:

        x-nullable: true
        default: null
        description: True to match true values. False to match false values.
