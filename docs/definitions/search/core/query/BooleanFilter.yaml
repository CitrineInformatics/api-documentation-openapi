description: A filter against the value of a boolean-typed field.
properties:
    logic:
        $ref: logic.yaml
    exists:
        $ref: exists.yaml
    equal:
        type: boolean
        nullable: true
        default: null
        description: True to match true values. False to match false values.
    filter:
        type: array
        items:
            type: object
            description: BooleanFilter type. This is a recursive definition.
        nullable: true
        default: null
        description: Nested boolean filters. Filters can nest as deeply as needed in order to create complex combinations of boolean logic.
examples:
    simple:
        value:
            equal: true
        summary: A simple test that a value is equal to true.
    exists:
        value:
            exists: false
        summary: Test that the field does not exist.
    notTrue:
        value:
            logic: MUST_NOT
            equal: true
        summary: Test that the field is not equal to true. This will be satisfied when the field does not exist or when it does exist but is equal to false.
    nested:
        value:
            filter:
                - equal: false
                - exists: false
        summary: Match when it is true that the field has a value of false or when the field does not exist (the default logic is SHOULD between the two query objects).
