type: string

description: A string that is run against all fields in this object and their children. Strings are tokenized on whitespace unless surrounded by quotes. For example, _GaN "band gap"_ tokenizes to _GaN_ and _band gap_ where each token must match the entire phrase in a record. Tokens are executed with boolean OR logic. Therefore, _GaN "band gap"_ matches records that contain _GaN_ or _band gap_. Since simple filters are, in this way, extremely inclusive operations, it is typically recommended that relevancy scoring be turned on for the query so that the records that match the most values are ranked the highest.
